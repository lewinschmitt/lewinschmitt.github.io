    title: "Why the Commission?"
    excerpt: "The European Commission is one of the most central bodies in EU politics, boasting a workforce of over 32,000 civil servants. However, it suffers from a diversity gap when it comes to the representativeness of its staff across many key dimensions."

    title: "Why diversity matters"
    excerpt: "In terms of justice, a political organisation should strive for optimum representativeness in its workforce. Inclusiveness is indispensable for social justice as it improves citizens’ access to institutions regardless of their background and enhances the Commission’s representativeness of the overall EU population."

    title: "The inequality of meritocracy"
    excerpt: "EPSO's focus on so-called meritocratic recruitment procedures, especially the computer-based and standardized testing schemes, fails to acknowledge an important aspect behind unequal representation in the Commission's workforce: not all demographic groups have the same starting point."
